## Meet the Developers behind Lend a Hand

### David Wever
I am a computer science major at the University of Alabama. I am a jack of all trades, with experience in construction, engineering, and music. I am learning how to woodwork and have built a chess set out of origami. At First Baptist, I play the bass and lead bible studies, and I hope to become a counselor after I retire. My top three priorities are God, family, and work, in that order. Because of my desire to glorify God, I have decided to help participate in building LendaHand for my capstone computing project.

### Marcus Marshall
I'm an undergrad at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science. I have focused my academic studies on learning how to create technology that is both useful and intuitive through User Experience (UX) design. I am mindful of the privacy, security, and technology addiction issues that come with having technology so readily available. Moreover, I plan to create a consumer technology company that understands and addresses those challenges.

### Seth Klumph
Seth Klumph is a senior computer science student at The University of Alabama. His interests include Game Development, Testing, and Design, as well as Software Engineering and Mobile Development. He is in the honors college and enjoys spending his free time playing video games and developing game concepts.

### Victoria Basilio
