## Meet the Developers behind Lend a Hand

### David Wever

### Marcus Marshall
I'm an undergrad at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science. I have focused my academic studies on learning how to create technology that is both useful and intuitive through User Experience (UX) design. I am mindful of the privacy, security, and technology addiction issues that come with having technology so readily available. Moreover, I plan to create a consumer technology company that understands and addresses those challenges.
