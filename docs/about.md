# About



## Marcus Marshall, Jr.
I'm an undergrad at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science who was born and raised in Opelika, Alabama. He has focused his academic studies on learning how to create technology that is useful and intuitive. Additionally, Marshall is also interested in mobile application development and User Experience (UX) design.
Marshall is mindful of the privacy, security, and technology addiction issues that come with having technology so readily available. With that in mind, his studies include devoting time to creating a consumer tech company that understands and addresses those challenges.
When not studying, Marcus can be found sharing time with family and friends and co-leading a college financial group, book club, and a career planning group. He also enjoys watching comedy or drama shows on TV.
