### What is LendaHand?

LendaHand is an Android and iOS app that seamlessly connects the next generation of volunteers to service opportunities. It aims to make finding a volunteer opportunity just as simple as it is to find a new app on the App Store. Additionally, it gives small and large volunteer based organizations a powerful tool to find volunteers.

The service caters to two user groups: volunteers and service organizations. 


### For Service Organizations

Users interested in hosting service opportunities can sign up as a service organization. Service organizations have an online dashboard where they can easily manage their available service opportunities and any information about themselves on the app.
